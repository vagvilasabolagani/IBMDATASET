# HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard

## Objective
This project aims to develop a Power BI Dashboard to comprehend employee attrition and explore the factors contributing to turnover, facilitating the development of effective retention strategies. The goal is to enhance retention and strengthen the workforce through actionable insights presented in the dashboard.

## Dataset
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance, includes details such as employee demographics, job attributes, performance ratings, and attrition status, facilitating analysis and understanding of turnover factors.

## Steps Undertaken

### Setting Objectives:
- Clarified scope and objectives, aiming to gain insights into employee attrition patterns.

### Data Collection and Exploration:
- Gathered HR attrition dataset from Kaggle.
- Analyzed the dataset to gain insights into employee demographics, job attributes, performance ratings, and attrition status. This involved visualizing distributions, correlations, and trends using descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques.

### Metric Development:
- Utilized Power BI Desktop and Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create key performance indicators (KPIs) such as attrition rate, department-wise turnover, etc.

### Dashboard Creation:
- Developed an interactive dashboard in Power BI Desktop to visualize the analysis results. The dashboard includes various visualizations, filters, and slicers to facilitate the exploration and understanding of employee attrition patterns.
